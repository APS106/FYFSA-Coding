By the last lecture on Friday, the lecture content surpassed where I reached in the textbook despite me trying to stay one class ahead in my own preparation. Seeing that coding will require practice, I do foresee myself falling behind quickly once the semester workload picks up and lecture content continues at this pace.  So though I am very interested to learn, I am fearful about not being able to keep up, not because of difficulty but pace. 

To be clear, the lectures move at a reasonable pace, but in conjunction with everything else I'll have to do in the coming weeks, that's when the pace would start to work against me.  That might be a personal problem I guess.
