Those took me half the time, but this year’s took the whole 90 minutes. I struggled to understand what question 4 and 5 were asking me. Especially question 5, the Taylor Series problem. I did not like the way it was worded in a really chunky paragraph and how it had no example cases. If there was a sample input/output, it would have made it easier to understand the question. It’s also happened to be something I never learned before (it’s part of MAT187, but we haven’t learned it yet), so it was difficult to wrap my head around it. The other problem I had was that I wasn’t sure if 1 was a term in e^x = 1 + x + … I had to state my assumption on the side because there was no clarification. This wouldn’t have needed much thought if some case scenarios had been given. I also struggled to understand how the parameter”precision” worked. I had to give it a lot of thought which limited my time to actually write down my code. Once again,”precision” would have been easier to understand if some test cases were given or numbers were used. 

Other than the above, the test questions weren’t too difficult, but the formatting of this midterm could have been better.

For the multiple-choice, I remember that there was a question related to ASCII codes. I know that multiple lectures and tutorials told us not to memorize the ASCII code numbers but to just know which is greater than the other ( 'a' > 'A') but for that question you actually needed to remember the numbers for each of the values given based off of the ASCII codes to successfully convert between 'ord' and 'chr'. 

Additionally, the last two codes were very overwhelming. As someone who had just learnt how to code in Python this semester, I was very bewildered to see that those two coding problems required not only while loops (which we had very recently learned) but also math...? I know we had some exposure to these problems somewhat (week 4 tutorial and midterm jeopardy) but to put it as questions on a midterm was very unusual especially since we had never properly gone over the problem-solving aspects for these types of problems. During the midterm, I spent most of the time trying to figure out the math rather than the code, which I feel defeats the whole purpose of these questions since they should be test you on coding knowledge.

Pretty much a lot of things surprised me on this midterm. I felt pretty prepared coming into it as I was up to date on all the content and had studied a few days in advance. So seeing these problems this week really made me question my coding capabilities in this course...",0.0,I somewhat understand,0.0,I somewhat understand,0.0,"Please give more resources for studying for midterms and content in general for this course.
