Those took me half the time, but this year’s took the whole 90 minutes. I struggled to understand what question 4 and 5 were asking me. Especially question 5, the Taylor Series problem. I did not like the way it was worded in a really chunky paragraph and how it had no example cases. If there was a sample input/output, it would have made it easier to understand the question. It’s also happened to be something I never learned before (it’s part of MAT187, but we haven’t learned it yet), so it was difficult to wrap my head around it. The other problem I had was that I wasn’t sure if 1 was a term in e^x = 1 + x + … I had to state my assumption on the side because there was no clarification. This wouldn’t have needed much thought if some case scenarios had been given. I also struggled to understand how the parameter”precision” worked. I had to give it a lot of thought which limited my time to actually write down my code. Once again,”precision” would have been easier to understand if some test cases were given or numbers were used. 

Other than the above, the test questions weren’t too difficult, but the formatting of this midterm could have been better. Especially when students were expected to suddenly understand what Taylor Series for e^x were and what the parameter “precision” meant.",I somewhat understand,I somewhat understand,"I’m hoping that the formatting for the midterm 2 is better than the midterm 1, with more test cases or better explanations.

Lecture slides are great for refreshing your memory and they are made very well. Then looking at examples from the Jupyter notebooks to supplement some of the reviewed content is also useful. The practice problems are great for practicing problem-solving skills and structure but some can take too long to complete, and they still didn't prepare me as much for the critical thinking I had to do on the exam. The review questions in class and the past midterms were helpful to be more familiar with the style and type of content for the midterm, but the midterm still caught us off guard!","Problems 4 and 5. I'm sure that many of us feel similarly about how we had to struggle through these last parts of the test. They required a lot of thinking, and I was disappointed in myself for how I could not wrap my head around how to translate the Fibonacci sequence into code. I felt that I could have done these problems if I had more time and less pressure, but in the pressure of the moment they just ended up hurting my head and leaving me surprisingly disappointed. I had felt much more confident going into the test and was doing fine until problem 4.",I somewhat understand,I somewhat understand,"Scrolling is still happening too fast, not always but often.

The resources most helpful were tutorial recordings and past midterms.","A lot of things... actually.

For the multiple-choice, I remember that there was a question related to ASCII codes. I know that multiple lectures and tutorials told us not to memorize the ASCII code numbers but to just know which is greater than the other ( 'a' > 'A') but for that question you actually needed to remember the numbers for each of the values given based off of the ASCII codes to successfully convert between 'ord' and 'chr'. 

Additionally, the last two codes were very overwhelming. As someone who had just learnt how to code in Python this semester, I was very bewildered to see that those two coding problems required not only while loops (which we had very recently learned) but also math...? I know we had some exposure to these problems somewhat (week 4 tutorial and midterm jeopardy) but to put it as questions on a midterm was very unusual especially since we had never properly gone over the problem-solving aspects for these types of problems. During the midterm, I spent most of the time trying to figure out the math rather than the code, which I feel defeats the whole purpose of these questions since they should be test you on coding knowledge.

Pretty much a lot of things surprised me on this midterm. I felt pretty prepared coming into it as I was up to date on all the content and had studied a few days in advance. So seeing these problems this week really made me question my coding capabilities in this course...",I somewhat understand,I somewhat understand,"Please give more resources for studying for midterms and content in general for this course. As someone who is learning all of this content currently and who had never coded in Python before this course, I feel at a complete disadvantage compared to some of my peers who most likely have had experience with Python since high school or through their extracurricular activities.
