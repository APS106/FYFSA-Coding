I have my Practical pretty later in the week which is Thursday, a very odd time for APS106 because the new lab is not posted yet but the previous one is almost due so I have very little time to get help with my lab assignment. Therefore, I hope the teaching team can post the weekly lab in a new and appropriate time window, which will help a lot of students with similar situations as me. ",0.0,5,11,1.0
