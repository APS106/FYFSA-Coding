    "## Problem Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Madlibs is a story game for kids: a story is written and a few important words are taken out, replaced by blanks. The blanks are labelled with their part of speech or other category (\"noun\", \"adjective\", \"an animal\", and so on). One kid reads out the categories, another kid (or kids) supply new words without knowing the story. When all the blanks have been filled in, the story is read out, hopefully with silly results (this is a game for kids, afterall).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an [online example](https://www.madtakes.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Define the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We have learned up to now, we would like to develop a simple Madlib game. Internally the game will be provided with sample stories with certain words removed. The player will be repeatedly prompted for new words that match certain grammatical or descriptive requirements. Once all the words have been entered, the story will be output for everyone to read and enjoy.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be great if the sample stories would be randomly generated each time we run the game or if we had a library of stories that we could read in. These are a bit beyond our abilities at the moment so for now, let’s go with some “hard-coded” story.\n",

    "Things to consider:\n",
    "-\tStoring a long story in a form that can easily be modified\n",
    "-\tPrompting the user for words\n",
    "-\tReplacing the words in the story with the ones entered by the user\n",
    "-\tDisplaying the story\n",
    "\n",
    "An obvious approach is to store the story as a string. However, how are we going to modify the story? (Strings are immutable!) How do we represent the words we want to replace with the user’s input?\n",
    "\n",
    "We talked about the `replace` method this week. It allows you to find and replace sub-strings. So that seems promising. \n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm Plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tProvide a story with missing words identified somehow. \n",
    "-\tStore strings corresponding to the word identifiers in separate variables.\n",
    "-\tPrompt user for words matching the word identifiers.\n",
    "-\tReplace word identifiers with user provided words.\n",
    "-\tDisplay the new story line.\n",
    "-   Profit!\n",
    "\n",
    "How are we going to represent missing words? One idea (which has some weaknesses) is to use unusual characters to represent the blanks. For example, we could store the blanks in the story between curly braces.\n",
    "\n",
    "`This is the {season} of our discount tent.`\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that we want to replace all the words inside curly braces. [You might consider what the problems are with this solution.]\n",
    "\n",
    "What about a Programming Plan?\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\twrite a story and display a story. Notice we are doing the first and last thing in the algorithm but since they should be pretty easy it’s not a bad idea. This way we get a “working” program right away – but of course it only does part of what we want to do.\n",
    "2. change the story to write the word identifiers in curly braces\n",
    "3.\treplace one word: prompt user for one of the word identifiers and then replace it in the string\n",
    "4.\trepeat the code in step 3 for the other word identifiers. Since we’ve done it for one word identifier, it should be easy to do it for the rest (you don’t know about loops yet so just do the simplest thing you can think of)\n",
    "\n",
    "And remember: you should not proceed to the next step until you are sure that the previous steps are working. Test as you go!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Select a Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems we only have one option. Let’s try it out and see if we run into problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "(In reality, we should probably think more about how to represent the blanks. There might be a much better solution that we haven't thought of.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implement the Solution\n",
