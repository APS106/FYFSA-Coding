    "\n",
    "For thousands of years cryptographers have made secret messages that only the sender and recipient could read. The secret code system (or algorithm) used for encrypting and decrypting messages is called a cipher. Even if the message (today’s equivalent would be a file) were to be captured, it would not help in decoding the message, since only sender and recipient would know the cipher.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the earliest examples of cryptography is the Caesar cipher which encrypts a message by taking each letter in the message and replacing it with a “shifted” letter. If you shift the letter A by one space, you get the letter B. If you shift the letter A by two spaces, you get the letter C. The Caesar cipher is overly simple and it wouldn’t take much to break the encryption. Even though the Caesar cipher is no longer used, it still makes for a great learning example for cryptography.  "

    "\n",
    "Given a sensitive message that should not be read by others, we would like devise an algorithm to encrypt the message so that only someone with the secret key can access it. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many options available for encryption ranging from classic methods that are not secure, to more modern ones that are highly mathematical. Since the message being encrypted is not of great importance, and there is little motivation for your friends to try and decrypt it, it makes sense to use an easier implementation, such as the Caesar cipher.\n",
